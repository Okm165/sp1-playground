# Quickstart

In this section, we will show you how to create a simple Fibonacci program using the SP1.

## Create Project

The first step is to create a new project using the `cargo prove new <name>` command. 

```bash
cargo prove new fibonacci
cd fibonacci
```

This will create a new project with the following structure:

```
.
├── program
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   ├── elf
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
└── script
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        └── main.rs

6 directories, 4 files
```

There are 2 directories (each a crate) in the project: 
- `program`: the source code that will be proven inside the zkVM.
- `script`: code that contains proof generation and verification code.

## Build Program

Before we can run the program inside the zkVM, we must compile it to a RISCV executable using the `succinct` Rust toolchain. 


The `cargo prove` CLI tool exposes a `build` command which you can run at the root of the `program` directory:
In this step, we compile the program in the `program/src/main.rs` file to a RISC-V executable. The program is a very simple program to compute the `n`-th Fibonacci number. The compiled executable is called an "ELF" and contains bytecode that can be executed by a RISC-V runtime. 
```bash
cd program
cargo prove build
```

The resulting compiled executable is called an [ELF (Executable and Linkable Format)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) and contains bytecode that can be executed by the SP1.


You can verify that the ELF was generated by looking in the `elf` directory and looking for a file called `riscv32im-sp1-zkvm-elf`:
```bash
ls elf
```

## Generate Proof

To generate a proof, we take the [ELF] file that was generated in the previous step and execute it within the SP1. The code in the `script` directory is already scaffolded with a script that has logic to generate a proof, save the proof to disk, and verify it.

```bash
cd ../script
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release
```
```
    Compiling fibonacci-script v0.1.0 (/Users/umaroy/Documents/fibonacci/script)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 26.14s
    Running `target/release/fibonacci-script`
a: 3867074829
b: 2448710421
succesfully generated and verified proof for the program!
```

The program by default is quite small, so proof generation will only take a few seconds locally. After it completes, the proof will be saved in the `proof-with-pis.json` file and also be verified for correctness.

You can play around with how many rounds of fibonacci executed by playing around with `n` (by default set to `5000`) in the file `script/src/main.rs`.

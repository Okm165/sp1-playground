# Quickstart

In this section, we will show you how to create a simple Fibonacci program using the SP1 zkVM.

## Create Project

The first step is to create a new project using the `cargo prove new <name>` command. This command will create a new folder in your current directory.

```bash
cargo prove new fibonacci
cd fibonacci
```

This will create a new project with the following structure:

```
.
├── program
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   ├── elf
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
└── script
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        └── main.rs

6 directories, 4 files
```

There are 2 directories (each a crate) in the project: 
- `program`: the source code that will be proven inside the zkVM.
- `script`: code that contains proof generation and verification code.

We recommend you install the [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) extension.
Note that if you use `cargo prove new` inside a monorepo, you will need to add the manifest file to `rust-analyzer.linkedProjects` to get full IDE support.

## Generate Proof

The program simply computes the `n`-th Fibonacci number.

Before we can run the program inside the zkVM, it must be compiled to a RISCV executable using the `succinct` Rust toolchain. This is called an [ELF (Executable and Linkable Format)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format). The `build.rs` file in the `script` directory will use the `cargo prove` toolchain to automatically build the ELF.

To generate a proof, we take the ELF file generated by the `build.rs` file and execute it within the SP1 zkVM. The code in the `script` directory is already scaffolded with a script that has logic to generate a proof and verify it.

```bash
cd script
cargo run --release
```

The output should show
```
...
warning: fibonacci-script@0.1.0: fibonacci-program built at 2024-07-17 09:58:16
    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 0.41s
     Running `target/release/prove`
n: 20
Successfully generated proof!
fib(n): 10946
```

The program by default is quite small, so proof generation will only take a few seconds locally. After it completes, the proof will be verified for correctness.

## Modifying the Program

You can play around with how many rounds of Fibonacci are executed by playing around with `n` (by default set to `20`) in the file `script/src/prove.rs` or by passing it as an argument, e.g. `cargo run --release -- --n 30`. Integer overflow will cause `n > 186` to fail.

The ELF will be automatically rebuilt every time you modify the program. You can verify that the ELF was re-generated by looking in the `program/elf` directory for a file called `riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf`:
```bash
ls elf # should show riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf
```
